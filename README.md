# Functional programming with Java 1 (yes one!)

## Exercises
- We got generics! We no longer have to deal with heterogeneous lists and ugly type casts and instanceof checks. Refactor the code to take advantage of this new feature.
- We got the while loop! Whooho! No need to use the recursion anymore. Refactor the code to take advantage of this new feature.
- We got the collection API!!! (without streams of course). Now you can replace the LinkedList with your collections of choice.
